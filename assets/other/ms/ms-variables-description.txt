+ <PM25, PM10, CO, NO2, O3, SO2, wind_speed, humidity, sealevel_pressure, global_radiation, precipitation, average_temperature, min_temperature, max_temperature>_num:
	For each recorded variable, number of valid measurements in that week, ranging from 0 to 7.

	average of valid measurements in that week; if there are no valid measurements in that week, it is denoted as NA.

+<PM25, PM10, CO, NO2, O3, SO2>_who:
	PM25_who: number of days spent over the respective World Health Organization (WHO) threshold in that week (computed as following); if there are no valid measurements in that week, it is denoted as NA.


2) Definition of rules based on WHO Guidelines (only for air pollutants)

The rules are established based on WHO&#39;s recommended air quality guideline levels for short-term (24 hours) exposure to various air pollutants. Each rule compares the concentration of a pollutant to its respective WHO guideline level. If the concentration exceeds the guideline level, the rule assigns a value of 1; otherwise, it assigns a value of 0. Here are the rules for different pollutants levels for short-term (24 hours) exposure to air pollutants (reference: https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789240034228)
* For Carbon Monoxide (CO): if CO ≤ 4 mg/m3 then the value is 0; otherwise, it is 1
* For Nitrogen Dioxide (NO 2 ): if NO 2 ≤ 25 µg/m3 then the value is 0; otherwise, it is 1
* For Ozone (O3): if O 3 ≤ 100 µg/m3 then the value is 0; otherwise, it is 1
* For Particulate Matter with a diameter of 2.5 micrometers or smaller (PM 2.5): if PM 2.5 ≤ 15
µg/m 3 then the value is 0; otherwise, it is 1
* For Particulate Matter with a diameter of 10 micrometers or smaller (PM 10 ): if PM 10 ≤ 45 µg/m3 , then the value is 0; otherwise, it is 1
* For Sulfur Dioxide (SO 2 ); if SO 2 ≤ 40 µg/m3 , then the value is 0; otherwise, it is 1

3) Unit of measure of variables:
PM25, PM10, CO, NO2, O3, SO2: micrograms per cubic meter (µg/m3)
Wind speed: m/s
Relative humidity: %
Sea level pressure: hPa
Global radiation: W/m²
Precipitation sum: mm
Average temperature: °C
Minimum temperature: °C
Maximum temperature: °C
